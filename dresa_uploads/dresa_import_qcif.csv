Version Control with Git,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/version-control-with-git/,"""Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.""",20230420T090000,20230420T123000,Australia/Brisbane,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,,workshop;,hosts,,,"""Prior knowledge of SPSS is required as the basics of SPSS will not be covered""","""Attendees must provide their own SPSS licence"""
Containers for Reproducible Computational Environments,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/container-intro/,"""Containers are self-contained pieces of software that allow you to run applications easily across all sorts of different computing hardware – from your laptop to your institutional high-performance computing system – without the need for a complicated installation process. Containers are also an effective way of achieving a reproducible analysis pipeline, allowing researchers to ensure that the same version of an application and consistent computational environment are used each time. This short introductory course will show you how to find and use Singularity containers in a typical university HPC (high performance computing) context.<br>The workshop does not cover the use of the Docker container platform, although you will learn how to import Docker containers into Singularity.""",20230516T090000,20230516T120000,Australia/Brisbane,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,,workshop;,hosts,,"""<ul><li>What are containers, and where to find them</li><li>How to load and run containers using Singularity on HPC</li><li>Accessing local datafiles from a container</li></ul>""","""Basic experience with Unix or Linux is required.

Introduction to Unix,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/introduction-to-unix/,"""The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including 'high-performance computing' supercomputers). This Software Carpentry workshop will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.""",20230619T090000,20230619T123000,Australia/Brisbane,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,,workshop;,hosts,,,,
Introduction to HPC,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/introduction-to-hpc/,"""High-Performance Computing, or HPC, is the use of computers orders of magnitude faster and more powerful than even the best desktop PC. As research becomes more and more data-intensive, an ever broader range of researchers are using HPC for their data analysis. This workshop will give you an introduction to using high-performance computing systems effectively (as well as their limitations), and will introduce the basics of how to access a HPC cluster, load and use software, and submit jobs to run.""",20230717T090000,20230717T130000,Australia/Brisbane,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,host_institution; ,QCIF,true,,,,workshop;,free,,"""<ul><li>Understand the difference between a HPC and a server or laptop</li><li>Learn how to log into a HPC and transfer files</li><li>Understand about available storage and its limitations</li><li>Learn how to load software on the HPC</li><li>Learn how to submit a job and understand how to request appropriate resources</li></ul>""","""Participants must have access to an HPC cluster to attend the course.
