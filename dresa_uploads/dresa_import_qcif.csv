A Guide to Reproducible Research,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/guide-to-reproducible-research/,"""The idea that you can duplicate an experiment and get the same conclusion is the basis for all scientific discoveries. Reproducible research is data analysis that starts with the raw data and offers a transparent workflow to arrive at the same results and conclusions. However not all studies are replicable due to lack of information on the process. Therefore reproducibility in research is extremely important. Researchers genuinely want to make their research more reproducible, but sometimes don't know where to start and often don't have the available time to investigate or establish methods on how reproducible research can speed up every day work. We aim for the philosophy 'Be better than you were yesterday'. Reproducibility is a process, and we highlight there is no expectation to go from beginner to expert in a single workshop. Instead, we offer some steps you can take towards the reproducibility path following our Steps to Reproducible Research self paced program.""",20220525T133000,20220525T150000,Australia/Brisbane,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,,webinar;,hosts,,,,
