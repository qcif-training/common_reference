Version Control with Git,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/version-control-with-git/,"""Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.""",20230420T090000,20230420T123000,Australia/Brisbane,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,,workshop;,hosts,,,"""Prior knowledge of SPSS is required as the basics of SPSS will not be covered""","""Attendees must provide their own SPSS licence"""
Containers for Reproducible Computational Environments,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/container-intro/,"""Containers are self-contained pieces of software that allow you to run applications easily across all sorts of different computing hardware – from your laptop to your institutional high-performance computing system – without the need for a complicated installation process. Containers are also an effective way of achieving a reproducible analysis pipeline, allowing researchers to ensure that the same version of an application and consistent computational environment are used each time.

Introduction to Unix,https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/introduction-to-unix/,"""The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including 'high-performance computing' supercomputers). This Software Carpentry workshop will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.""",20230619T090000,20230619T123000,Australia/Brisbane,training@qcif.edu.au,QCIF,open_to_all;,QCIF,true,,,,workshop;,hosts,,,,
